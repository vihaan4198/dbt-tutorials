### **CI/CD Pipeline Setup for dbt Using GitHub Actions**

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** to automate the testing and deployment of dbt models. The goal is to automatically test dbt models whenever a new commit or pull request is made and then deploy the models if the tests pass.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites:**

- **dbt** project setup
- **GitHub repository** for your dbt project
- **Snowflake/Aurora** or any other supported database set up with dbt
- **dbt profile** set up (ensure that your `profiles.yml` is configured correctly)
- **GitHub Actions** enabled in your GitHub repository

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File**

GitHub Actions uses YAML configuration files to define workflows. These files are placed in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

Letâ€™s create a workflow for **dbt testing** and **deployment**.

1. **Create the directory** if it doesnâ€™t exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Create a new workflow file** inside `.github/workflows`, for example: `dbt_ci_cd.yml`.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Define the Workflow for Testing and Deployment**

Hereâ€™s an example GitHub Actions workflow to automate dbt testing and deployment:

### **.github/workflows/dbt_ci_cd.yml**

```yaml
name: dbt CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main        # Trigger pipeline on push to main branch
      - develop     # Trigger pipeline on push to develop branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main        # Trigger pipeline for pull requests targeting main branch

jobs:
  # 1. Job to test dbt models
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use an Ubuntu runner for the workflow
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'  # Specify the Python version required for dbt

      - name: Install dbt
        run: |
          pip install dbt-snowflake  # Install the dbt package for Snowflake or other adapter

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have extra dependencies in requirements.txt

      - name: Set up dbt profile
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.dbt  # Create dbt folder for profile
          echo "$DBT_PROFILE" > ~/.dbt/profiles.yml  # Use GitHub Secrets to inject profiles.yml

      - name: Run dbt tests
        run: |
          dbt run --models tag:staging  # Running only staging models, modify this according to your use case
          dbt test --models stg_customers, stg_orders  # Run tests after models

      - name: Check dbt test result
        if: failure()  # If dbt tests fail, stop the workflow
        run: |
          echo "dbt tests failed!"
          exit 1

  # 2. Job to deploy dbt models (Only runs after passing tests)
  deploy:
    needs: test  # Ensure deployment only happens after tests pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'  # Specify the Python version required for dbt

      - name: Install dbt
        run: |
          pip install dbt-snowflake  # Install the dbt package for Snowflake or other adapter

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have extra dependencies in requirements.txt

      - name: Set up dbt profile
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.dbt  # Create dbt folder for profile
          echo "$DBT_PROFILE" > ~/.dbt/profiles.yml  # Use GitHub Secrets to inject profiles.yml

      - name: Run dbt models
        run: |
          dbt run --models tag:staging  # Running only staging models, modify this according to your use case

      - name: Run dbt tests after deployment (optional)
        run: |
          dbt test --models stg_customers, stg_orders  # Optional: Run tests after deployment
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Explanation:**

1. **Triggers (`on`)**:
   - This pipeline is triggered on `push` to `main` or `develop` branches and for `pull_request` events targeting `main`. You can adjust these triggers based on your development flow.

2. **Job 1: Testing dbt Models**:
   - **Checkout repository**: The first step checks out your code from GitHub.
   - **Set up Python**: We need Python 3.8 for dbt.
   - **Install dbt**: We install the dbt package (dbt-snowflake, modify if using another adapter).
   - **Install dependencies**: If you have additional dependencies, use a `requirements.txt` file.
   - **Set up dbt profile**: This step creates a `.dbt/profiles.yml` file, which stores the credentials for your database. We'll inject this via a GitHub secret.
   - **Run dbt models**: This runs your dbt models.
   - **Run dbt tests**: This runs dbt tests to validate your models (e.g., checking uniqueness, not null).
   - **Test result check**: If the tests fail, the pipeline is stopped, and an error message is shown.

3. **Job 2: Deploy dbt Models**:
   - This job depends on the success of the `test` job.
   - If the tests pass, it proceeds to deploy the models (`dbt run`).
   - Optionally, you can run dbt tests again after deployment to ensure the models are still correct.

## **ðŸ“Œ Step 3: GitHub Secrets for Database Configuration**

To securely manage your database credentials (e.g., for Snowflake, Aurora), we use **GitHub Secrets**. This allows sensitive information like passwords and tokens to be injected into your workflow.

1. **Go to your GitHub repository settings**.
2. **Click on "Secrets"** and then **"New repository secret"**.
3. **Add a secret** for your dbt profile (e.g., `DBT_PROFILE`).
4. In the secret, you can store your entire `profiles.yml` as a string, and it will be injected into the workflow during the `Set up dbt profile` step.

Example profile in `DBT_PROFILE`:

```yaml
my_snowflake_dbt:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: <your_account>
      user: <your_user>
      password: <your_password>
      role: <your_role>
      database: <your_database>
      warehouse: <your_warehouse>
      schema: <your_schema>
```

## **ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Running and Monitoring the CI/CD Pipeline**

1. **Push changes to GitHub**:
   - Commit and push your changes to the repository. This will automatically trigger the pipeline.
   - If you are pushing to a pull request, GitHub Actions will also run the tests for that PR.

2. **Monitor the pipeline**:
   - Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to see the progress of the workflow.
   - Each step will show whether it succeeded or failed.
   - You can view the logs for each task and debug any issues if the workflow fails.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Best Practices**

1. **Environment Management**:
   - Ensure you have a clear distinction between your development, staging, and production environments in your `profiles.yml`.
   - You can set up different GitHub Secrets for each environment to manage multiple configurations.

2. **Separate Testing and Deployment**:
   - Always run dbt tests before deployment. This ensures that you are deploying only validated models.

3. **Limit Resource Usage**:
   - Limit the models being run in a single job to avoid overloading the CI/CD pipeline.
   - You can use **dbt tags** or the `--models` flag to run specific models.

4. **Version Control for dbt Models**:
   - Always version control your `dbt` models and configurations to maintain an auditable history of changes.

5. **Slack or Email Notifications**:
   - Set up notifications for failed jobs to alert the team immediately. Use **Slack** or **Email** notification systems to inform stakeholders of failed tests or deployments.

| Step                          | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step 1:** Create Workflow File | Create a `.github/workflows/dbt_ci_cd.yml` file in your GitHub repo. |
| **Step 2:** Define Testing & Deployment Jobs | Set up dbt tests and deployment steps in the workflow. |
| **Step 3:** Set up GitHub Secrets | Inject sensitive data (like dbt profiles) using GitHub secrets. |
